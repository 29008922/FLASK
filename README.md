# 🧪 Half-Life Calculator for Secondary Schools

This is a **simple, interactive Half-Life Calculator** built using Python's **Flask web framework**, designed to assist **secondary school teachers** when teaching the **Radioactivity** topic in Chemistry.

Teachers can use this tool to demonstrate how radioactive substances decay over time and help students visualize the concept of **half-life** in a fun and engaging way.

## 🔍 Key Features

- Calculate remaining radioactive substance over time
- Interactive input for initial mass, half-life, and time
- Clean, easy-to-use web interface
- Ideal for classroom demos or student lab sessions
- Lightweight and runs locally — no internet needed

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.13**
- **Flask (Micro web framework)**
- **HTML/CSS for frontend**
- Developed using **Visual Studio Code**

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Python 3.13+** installed. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

You'll also need to install Flask:

```bash
pip install flask
2. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/29008922/half-life-calculator.git
cd half-life-calculator
3. Run the App
bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
Then open your browser and go to:

cpp

🖥️ VS Code Tips (For Teachers or Students)
Use the Python extension for linting and debugging

Run your Flask app with the built-in terminal

Edit and customize the web page in the templates/ folder

🧠 Educational Use Case
This calculator is perfect for:

Demonstrating how a radioactive sample decays over multiple half-lives

Showing the exponential nature of decay

Allowing students to explore how different half-lives and time periods affect the remaining mass

Class exercises and assignments
